# ServerGuide
**Guide players on your MC:PE server!**

## Features
Gives **@player** a book or any item configured in config.yml on Join. When the player taps the item, **@player** gets a list of helps! No need to  run /rules or /guide and stuff!

Supports unlimited helplist xD ! From MC:PE 1.0.0, players can **scroll** also ;)
